            <h3><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
            <p>I am Elizabeth Pammi, sixth of the seven children to my parents, currently a student of
                <abbr title="California State University at Long Beach"><a href="http://www.csulb.edu">CSULB</a></abbr> in pursuit of master's degree in Computer Science.
                There are few important people that influenced and shaped my life to where I was and where I am now.
                My father was born in less than minimum wage family, and sustained with single meal for each day or sometimes no meal at all.
                But he was very fervent about education and knew the importance of education looking at his family circumstances.
                Learning English was his major goal in order for him to pursue higher education.
                Hence he invested a lot of hard work in learning english and writing competitive exams which finally made him a merit student in Mechanical Engineering.
                Now, he is the Chief Transport Officer in our city (Hyderabad).
                Despite the large family with too many responsibilities, with a deepest desire my parents take care of homeless, widows, orphans and the slum.
                No matter the expenditure or responsibilities etc., my parents never compromised on the educating their children in reputed schools.
                All of my siblings have completed their higher education and Post Graduation in various fields.
                With the strong influence and expectations of my father I have always been a merit student throughout my schooling years.
                All this together have taught me how to be a firm believer of tolerance,  which laid the foundation to pursue my career.</p>

         <h3>Educational Background</h3>
			 <em>High School</em> - <a href="http://www.stanns.in/">St. Anns High School</a> (1994 - 2008)<br />
				<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Ann's_High_School,_Secunderabad">
					The school is named after Saint Anne, known by tradition as the mother of The Virgin Mary.
                    The school's motto is "Sicutapis Operosa" which translates from Latin to English as "Busy As Bees"
				</blockquote>
            <p id="highschool"> It is one of the top rated schools in the state. I was first introduced to computers in my high school.
                It was one of the first schools that introduced computers to the course structure of Secondary School Education.
                I was amazed at the capability of computers to provide fast and effective solutions for a plethora of applications that were used daily.
                I have never left my passion away from one of my interesting subjects, Mathematics that which is the underlying field out of which, Computer
            	Science was evolved. The passion towards Mathematics and Sciences reflected in my high school grades
            	securing me more than Ninety Percent in Advanced Mathematics and Sciences. My passion towards Computer Science
            	developed strong qualitative and analytical skills in me, which seemed logical that I should pursue a degree
            	in Engineering. After graduating from my high school, I felt that engineering would be the right choice in
            	leading me towards the opportunity to learn and explore the field Computer Science and Computer Technology
		    	which are intelligibly merged to derive possible solutions for practical and real world problems.</p>
		    	
			 <em>Undergraduation</em> - <abbr title="Bharat Institute of Engineering and Technology"><a href="http://biet.ac.in">B.I.E.T</a></abbr> (2008 - 2012)<br />

                    To pursue my career in "Computer Science",
                    I had to take numerous steps towards my goal of becoming an engineer in Computer Science from one of the renowned institutions in India.
                    To further equip myself with intellectual depth & breadth along the greater practical knowledge which,
                    I knew that a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science is what I wanted to pursue after graduating from high school.
                    I got admitted into <abbr title="Bharat Institute of Engineering and Technology"><a href="http://biet.ac.in">B.I.E.T</a></abbr> for my bachelor’s degree.
                    The institute is under the affiliation of <abbr title="Jawaharlal Nehru Technology University"><a href="http://jntu.ac.in">J.N.T.U</a></abbr> at Hyderabad,
                    which is a deemed university in India. Graduating from this university, opened a much wider perspective of various opportunities in Computer Science.
                    Faculty staff at my college played a key role in developing a strong skill set in the field
                    of Computer Science. Early on in college, I was introduced to programming languages including C, C++, JAVA.
   	 			    Also, I became familiar with UNIX and Linux platforms. I then went on to take courses such as Computer
                    organization, Computer Architecture, Software Engineering, Data Structures, Computer Networks and Artificial
                    Intelligence to help deepen my theoretical understanding in Computer Science. In addition to the courses in
                    Computer science, I was also given a brief overview to other core subjects of the major fields in Engineering.
                </p>
    
    
                <p>
                    During my <strong>Sophomore year</strong>, my professor who was also the Dean of the University, taught C++ which gave me a
                    strong fundamental skill towards coding applications in the same year. Then, I chose Data Base Management
                    Systems (DBMS), which turned out to be my most exciting subject. I was introduced to different database models
                    such as the hierarchical model, network model, the relational model, multi-dimensional model, object relational
                    model, object oriented model. I then went on to take additional courses in DBMS including Relational DBMS
                    (RDBMS), Object Oriented Databases and XML Databases. I also started working on various database tools
                    including Oracle 8I, SQL Server, MySQL etc., that were used in developing dynamic web applications.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    It was in my <strong>Junior year</strong> that I worked on my first real world project, "BARCODE GENERATOR & RECOGNIZER",
                    the process of generating and reading barcodes without using any of the hardware generating machines. This
                    project in particular has shaped me into becoming an innovative engineer to design solutions for modern day challenges.
                    The technologies that I have learnt played an important role in developing many other projects.
                    In addition to developing applications, I was left with an ardent desire to pursue a career in research.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my <strong>Senior year</strong>, with a deepest interest in database systems and application development, I wanted to develop
                    a project that could give a great deal of advantage not only to the end-users of the technology but also help
                    our deteriorating environment. Hence I developed my own project called "ECO-CYCLE", a web-based application that
                    recommends users, the different ways of reusing/recycling products in every day life. This application is now
                    maintained by my University which is open to all the students in the University. The user interface provides
                    different methods we could use to recycle our everyday products in effective manner and also to sell them at a
                    lower price. Application is also designed to provide important techniques to recycle some of the harmful
                    products like non-biodegradable plastics. In developing this application, I employed PHP and HTML with
                    JQuery along with MySQL, as these technologies are still open source and also are easy to maintain.
                    I am currently writing applications using PHP with several database tools that can generate dynamic webpages.

            <p id="graduation">
                I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree program at <abbr title="California State University at Long Beach"><a href="http://www.csulb.edu">CSULB</a></abbr>,
                where I am thrilled to improve my skills and become a better innovative software enginner.
                My Undergrad degree has left me with keen sense of appreciation for the need of evolution in technology.
                Towards the end of my senior year in college, I was offered to work as a junior backend
             	developer at <abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation"><a href="http://www.ibm.com/us/en/">IBM</a></abbr>.
                Though, I was given an opportunity to pursue a career as a Software developer,
                I instead desired to continue pursuing higher studies to further equip myself with
                intellectual depth & breadth along the greater practical knowledge which I will face in my career.
                After a good deal of self evaluation, I have decided to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science.
