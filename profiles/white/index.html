	<h1>Kameron White's education</h1>
	<p>Welcome! This site gives a historical profile of the post-secondary education of Kameron White</p>
	<h2>Undergraduate studies</h2>
	<p>I began my undergraduate studies in Fall '95 at the <a href="http://unc.edu">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>.</p>
	<p>Taking 18 hours during the first semester of my freshman year, while running for <a href="http://congress.unc.edu">student government</a>, pledging 
	     a <a href="http://websites.omegafi.com/omegaws/pikappaalphaunc/about-us/chapter-history-2/?doing_wp_cron=1378309183.9881029129028320312500">fraternity</a>, 
	     and <a href="http://hesnotherenc.com/">partying</a> almost all of the time, was probably an ill-conceived execution of my original 
	     plan on going to medical school.</p>
	<p>In the end, I managed to graduate in four years without having to take summer school and I had a really great time along the way! 
	     I earned a degree from the <a href="http://www.jomc.unc.edu">School of Journalism and Mass Communication</a>, where I concentrated 
	     in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising">advertising</a> and 
	     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_marketing_communications">integrated marketing</a>. 
	     This degree has been valuable in helping to direct my web clients towards reaching their online marketing goals.</p>
	<h2>Career Transition</h2>
	<p>After graduating and moving to Los Angeles, I worked as an audio engineer for two years at <a href="http://www.wwoods.com/">Wild Woods</a> doing 
	     post-production sound engineering for reality TV. Then, eight more years of sound engineering at <a href="http://audiomechanics.com/">Audio Mechanics</a>, where I mastered 
	     soundtracks of many great classic films.</p>
	<p>I ultimately discovered that digital sound engineering was limited by the tools that were included in the software applications 
	     provided to the sound engineer by a software engineer.  That's when I decided that where I needed 
	     to be in the future wasn't sound engineering, but rather software engineering!</p>
	<p>Since my undergraduate major is in the area of journalism, rather than engineering, I attended two years at <a href="http://www.glendale.edu/">Glendale 
	     Community College</a> to earning prerequisite credits needed for enrollment into a graduate school for computer science.</p>
	<p>While at GCC, I studied calculus and the following subjects in computer science:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Java</li>
		<li>C++</li>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>Algorithms</li>
		<li>Data structures</li>
		<li>Computer architecture</li>
		<li>Assembly language</li>
		<li>Networking</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Graduate studies</h2>
	<p>When applying to graduate schools, I decided that the <a href="http://www.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/cecs/views/programs/grad/ms_cs.shtml"> the Computer Engineering and 
	    Computer Science Department</a>, at the <a href="http://www.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/cecs/views/programs/grad/ms_cs.shtml">California State University of 
	    Long Beach</a> would be the best choice.</p>
	<p>I began taking classes in Fall '11 and will become a candidate for graduation in 2014, upon completing five remaining courses.</p>
	<p>While in school at Long Beach, I've had classes in the following subjects:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Software engineering</li>
		<li>Net-centric computing</li>
		<li>Database fundamentals</li>
		<li>Design of dynamic websites</li>
		<li>Object-oriented analysis & design</li>
		<li>Advanced analysis of algorithms</li>
		<li>Advanced operating systems</li>
		<li>Advanced computer networking</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Before graduating, I would like the opportunity to work on projects related to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ruby</li>
		<li>C#.Net</li>
		<li>Search engine technology</li>
		<li>Mobile application development</li>
		<li>JavaEE enterprise development</li>
	</ul>
